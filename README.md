# Subdivision Surface Modeler

__Summary :__

In this program, a user can display, manipulate, and refine polygonal meshes.  The primary function demonstrated in this program is a smoothing algorithm based on the Catmull-Clark subdivision technique as it applies to quadrilateral faces.  Meshes are stored in a pseudo winged edge representation where each face, edge, and vertex points to the faces, edges, and vertices that it constitutes.  Users may generate a random height field or choose prefabricated polyhedral objects from the dropdown menu.
